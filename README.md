# Dash-Project

Installation
I recommend installing pandas, since you will most likely use them.

$ pip3 install pandas

Then, just install Dash. Plotly comes with Dash

$ pip3 install dash
If you'd like to control the version of Plotly installed, you can do for example:

$ pip3 install plotly==4.7.0
